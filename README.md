## About
This is a simple Kanban board application to help you stay organized and work in an agile approach.

The app currently will retain the data in memory for a single session, if you refresh the page or close it, the data in memory will clear.

## Functionality
- Add a task
- Move a task between the 3 categories: To Do, In Progress, & Done
- Remove a task
- Clear the board entirely

## Future enhancements
- Task editing
- Task prioritization
- Filter and search
- Set up user authentication using Firebase to allow the data to persist in more than one session. Data will be written to a Firestore database.
- Enable authenticated users to provide project scope to a chat bot and have their To Do section created for them.
